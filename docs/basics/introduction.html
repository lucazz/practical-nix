<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Nix is a a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems, and it solves two
issues that are inherent to most other package managers. In addition to being a
package manager, Nix is also the programming language you use to write package
specifications (called derivations) for the Nix package manager.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll see what these issues are and how Nix addresses them.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You are working on a web application, and you have a relational database
running on PostgreSQL, and your application expects a PostgreSQL 11 server to be
available in order to function. If you are on an Ubuntu Linux computer, you
probably ran <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">postgresql-11</span></code> which installed, among different
files, a binary at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin/postgres</span></code> which you can use to start the
database server.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 12 has been around for a while, and it has some interesting features
that you want to try. If you are on a recent version of Ubuntu Linux, you
can run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">postgresql-12</span></code> to upgrade the database server.</p>
<p>APT (the Ubuntu package manager) will fetch the metadata for the new PostgreSQL
package and notice it has a conflict with the previous version. It will then
remove all files associated with the previous version, update its internal
database that there’s no longer a conflicting PostgreSQL installed, and finally
proceed with installing the new version with a new binary at
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin/postgres</span></code>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">What about Docker?</p>
<p>More recently, developers have used Docker to alleviate the problems of
conflicting packages. Docker is an abstraction on top of vitualization
features of the operating system that allows software to install and run on
“mini operating systems” called containers.</p>
<p>Although effective at handling package conflicts, Docker introduces a
considerable amount of overhead. Containers are ephemeral and isolated by
default, and the user needs to manage networking and volume mounts in order
to communicate and persist state. Docker is also Linux-specific.</p>
<p>Containers tend to be more efficient when used to deploy large applications
on dynamic and distributed infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<p>What if we want to have the two versions installed at the same time? It’s
possible but brittle. Some package managers will, for example, installs Python 2
as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin/python</span></code> and Python 3 at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin/python3</span></code>, and you
will have to adjust your programs and scripts to be aware of the different
binary names.</p>
<div class="section" id="nested-package-management">
<h3>Nested Package Management<a class="headerlink" href="#nested-package-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you work on a high-level programming language such as Ruby or JavaScript,
you are probably not using just the operating system package manager.
Because packages in these languages are generally smaller in size and developed
at a faster pace, developers of the these languages end up installing a single
OS-level package which is also a package manager for other langauge-specific
packages.</p>
<p>To make things worse, these high-level languages have package managers for
managing different versions of the language itself. If you are a Ruby developer on
macOS, you probably use homebrew for managing OS-level packages, something like
RVM for managing different versions of Ruby, and finally RubyGems for managing
your Ruby-specific packages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-nix-way">
<h2>The Nix Way<a class="headerlink" href="#the-nix-way" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nix makes package management purely functional and immutable. That means every
package (and every new version of a package) is installed to a new, separate
location. It also means that packages only dependent on the inputs used to build
it.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the Python version example. When you ask Nix to install Python
3, it will create a new directory at something like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/nix/store/zqr5sy6dxnas41s0axyhhvlqnhwj0ywk-python3-3.7.5/</span></code>. The random
string before the package name is the unique identifier of that package and is
calculated based on the build inputs. If you try to install the same version of
Python (including build flags and dependecies) again, Nix will notice it already
exists in the store and do nothing.</p>
<p>You can then install Python 2 with no risk of conflict because the unique
identifier and the package name are different. In fact, you can install
variations of the same Python 3.7.5 with no problems.</p>
<p>In practice, once you build and run a package successfully, you can expect it to
continue to build and run indefinitely and independent of its external
environment.</p>
<p>Over the next two chapters you will learn how to manage packages with Nix and
how to create your own.</p>
